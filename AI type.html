    <h1><b>Types Of Artificial Intelligence</b></h1>
    <p>The proliferation of data and other online resources has caused an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence.<br>
        But not all AI is equal. We'll look at four different types of artificial intelligence<br>
        to give you an idea of how it's developed and how AI is being used.</p>
        <h2>1.Machine Learning</h2>
        <P>The idea behind machine learning is to use sample data to train computer programs to recognize patterns based on algorithms.<br>
             Machine learning programs allow computers to do things without being programmed. The efficiency of machine learning<br>
              generally depends on the algorithm.

            A relatively common use of machine learning happens if you have a Pinterest (PINS 2.56%) account.<br>
             The image-sharing and social media website began using machine learning with the acquisition of Kosei in 2015;<br>
             since then, it's employed machine learning to help users discover content, moderate spam, direct advertising,<br>
             and target newsletters.
            
    </P>
    <h2>2.Neural networks</h2>
    <p>Neural networks are computer systems designed to imitate the neurons in a brain. The networks are designed to learn<br>
         via processing examples, using a well-understood input and a predicted result. As the network gains experience,<br>
          its output mirrors the targeted result.

        Alphabet (GOOGL 2.02%)(GOOG 1.98%), the parent company of search giant Google, for example, has been researching<br>
        neural networks since 2014. Its DeepMind project seeks to use artificial intelligence to build even more powerful algorithms.<br>
        The project is best known for its neural network that learned how to play 49 different Atari video games by viewing pixels<br>
        and a score on a screen.</p>
        <h2>3.Natural language processing</h2>
        <p>Natural language processing is often confused with simple speech recognition. It certainly includes the ability<br>
            to understand speech, but it involves more than simple audio-to-text (and vice versa) translations.<br>
            One of the goals of natural language processing is the design of a computer to fully understand and analyze documents.

            Microsoft (MSFT 0.33%) has become a major player in the field since investing $13 billion in OpenAI, the startup<br>
            that created ChatGPT. Its Azure is the sole cloud provider for the generative chatbot and offers sentiment analysis,<br>
            text classification, and text summarization, among others.</p>
            <h2>4.Robotics</h2>
            <p>The use of robots dates back hundreds of years, but machines that could assist people without actual human involvement<br>
                are considerably newer. One of the first autonomous robots was installed in 1961 and used to lift hot pieces of metal<br>
                from a machine. Since then, robots have become far more common. They're used in applications ranging from space<br>
                exploration to vacuuming your carpet.


                Robotics has evolved beyond industrial uses and are used in a wide range of applications, including medicine.<br>
                The da Vinci system created by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.57%), for example, is used for a wide range of procedures<br>
                including cardiac valve, prostate, and gynecological surgeries.</p>
